This app started as my first Android app to teach me the basic principles of Android development. It now has over 600 reviews and almost 100,000 downloads on the Play Store.

Working on this project successfully taught me both basic and advanced programming concepts.  

What it can help you with:
1. Cataloguing your books
2. Creating a wishlist
3. Finding books
4. Lending books
